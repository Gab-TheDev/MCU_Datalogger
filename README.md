# MCU_Datalogger
PCB design of an MCU datalogger

This project is based on the Data Logger design from KiCad Like a Pro. It involves creating a printed circuit board (PCB) for a microcontroller-based system that records environmental data. The main goal is to design, simulate, and lay out a functional PCB using KiCad, while learning key concepts in schematic capture, component placement, routing, and generating manufacturing files.

The data logger includes a microcontroller, voltage regulation, sensor interfaces (like temperature or humidity sensors), and a method for storing or transmitting data, such as an SD card or serial output. The focus is on building a solid foundation in PCB design practices, including signal integrity, component footprints, and creating a professional-quality layout.

By completing this project, I aim to:

- Gain hands-on experience with KiCadâ€™s schematic and PCB layout tools
- Understand the full workflow from schematic to fabrication
- Apply real-world design constraints (power supply, connectors, etc.)
- Build confidence in creating and testing custom electronics
